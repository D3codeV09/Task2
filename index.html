                    <p>Beer is the world's oldest[1][2][3] and most widely consumed[4] alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.[5] The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of sugars, mainly derived
                    from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used.[6] Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as
                    herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. </p>

                        <p>A vine (Latin vīnea "grapevine", "vineyard", from vīnum "wine") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (Vitis), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or scandent (that is, climbing) stems, lianas or runners.
                        The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work.[1][2] In the United Kingdom, the term "vine" applies almost exclusively to the grapevine. The term "climber" is used for all climbing plants.[3]</p>
